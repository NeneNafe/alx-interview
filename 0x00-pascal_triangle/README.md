PROJECT TITLE: PASCAL'S TRIANGLE

THINGS ONE NEED TO KNOW IN ORDER TO TACKLE THE PROJECT

1. Lists and List Comprehensions:

Understand how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.
Utilize list comprehensions for more concise and readable code, especially for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.

3. Functions:

Know how to define and call functions.
Pass parameters and return values, particularly how to return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.

4. Loops:

Use for and while loops to iterate through sequences.
Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.

5. Conditional Statements:

Apply if, elif, and else conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., the edges of the triangle always being 1).

6. Recursion (Optional):

While not strictly necessary, understanding recursion can provide an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
Recognize base cases and recursive cases for a function that generates the triangle’s rows.

7. Arithmetic Operations:

Perform addition, a fundamental operation for calculating each element of Pascal’s Triangle as the sum of the two elements directly above it.

8. Indexing and Slicing:

Access elements and slices of lists, crucial for identifying and summing the correct elements when constructing each row of the triangle.

9. Memory Management:

Be mindful of how lists are stored and copied, especially when creating new rows based on the values of the previous row.

10. Error and Exception Handling (Optional):

Use try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors, such as invalid input types or values.

11. Efficiency and Optimization:

Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
Evaluate and apply optimizations to improve the performance of the solution.
